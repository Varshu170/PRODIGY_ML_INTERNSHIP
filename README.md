## Task 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
 ###### 1.Load the dataset for house price prediction.
 ###### 2.Select relevant columns from the dataset.
 ###### 3.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
 ###### 4.Train the linear regression model using the selected features.
 ###### 5.Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
 ###### 6.Calculate and report the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
 ###### 7.Calculate and report the R-squared (RÂ²) value.
 ###### 8.Determine and report the model's coefficients.
 ###### 9.Determine and report the model's intercept.
## Task 2: K means clustering for grouping the customers of a retail store.
 ###### 1.Load the dataset containing customers' purchase history.
 ###### 2.Preprocess the data for clustering (e.g., normalization).
 ###### 3.Apply the K-means clustering algorithm.
 ###### 4.Use methods like the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
 ###### 5.Analyze and visualize the clustered groups for customer segmentation.
## Task 3: Hand Gesture Classification
 ###### 1.Load and preprocess the hand gesture dataset.
 ###### 2.Extract relevant features from images or video frames.
 ###### 3.Define a suitable model architecture, like CNN for image data.
 ###### 4.Compile and train the model using the dataset.
 ###### 5.Evaluate the model's performance with metrics like accuracy.
## Task 4: SVM for Classification for Dogs and Cats
 ###### 1.Load the necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, os, cv2, etc.).
 ###### 2.Access and load the Kaggle dataset for cats and dogs images.
 ###### 3.Preprocess the data: resize images, convert to grayscale if needed, normalize pixel values, and label images.
 ###### 4.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
 ###### 5.Flatten images to 1D feature vectors.
 ###### 6.Train the SVM model with chosen parameters (e.g., kernel type) on the training data.
 ###### 7.Use the trained SVM model to predict labels for the test set.
 ###### 8.Evaluate the model's accuracy and generate a classification report.
 ###### 9.Visualize sample images with their predicted labels to verify performance.
